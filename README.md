Team Roles:
1)Business analyst (BA):A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements.
2)Product owner (PO): Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog. Associated mainly with flexible Agile environments, a product owner is particularly useful in scenarios where requirements and workflows frequently change.
3)Project manager (PM): project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.
4)UI/UX designer: A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.

The UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is, thus, involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more. A UI designer, in turn, devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product.
5)Software architect: An architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software design decisions on behalf of an app development team.
6)Software developer: A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.

Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.

Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.

There are full-stack developers as well. They can handle all the work at once—from clients to servers to databases and all the needed integrations.
7)Quality assurance (QA) engineer: The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.
8)Test automation engineer: A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.
8)DevOps engineer:  DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.

How:
Secure password storage using bcrypt hashing
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for hosts and admins
OAuth/Social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.)
Email verification on sign-up
Why It Matters:
Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts.
Essential for protecting personal data, bookings, and property listings.
2. Authorization

What: Controls what authenticated users are allowed to do.

How:
Role-based access control (RBAC) (e.g., guest, host, admin)
Middleware to restrict actions like deleting properties to only the owner or admins
Why It Matters:
Prevents privilege escalation (e.g., a guest modifying another host’s property).
Ensures users only perform actions allowed for their role.
3. Rate Limiting

What: Restricts how often users can make requests to the API.

How:
Custom rate limits for login, search, and booking endpoints
Why It Matters:

Protects against brute force attacks and abuse (e.g., repeated login attempts)
Reduces risk of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks
4. Input Validation & Sanitization

What: Ensures that data submitted by users is clean and expected.

How:
Escape HTML in user inputs to prevent XSS
Why It Matters:
Prevents attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, etc.
Ensures integrity of stored and displayed data
5. Secure Payments

What: Ensures payment transactions are processed safely and privately.

How:
Use of secure, PCI-DSS compliant providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
Tokenized payment methods
HTTPS for all payment endpoints
