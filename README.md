About the Project:
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

Learning Objective:
This project is tailored to enhance your expertise in modern software development practices. By completing these tasks, learners will:

Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
Implement advanced security measures for API development.
Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.
Requirements

To successfully complete the project tasks, learners must:

Have a GitHub account to create and manage repositories.
Be familiar with Markdown syntax for README.md file creation.
Possess prior experience with backend frameworks like Django and database systems such as MySQL.
Understand software development lifecycle practices, including security, CI/CD, and database design.
Be comfortable with modern tools such as Docker, GitHub Actions, or similar CI/CD platforms.

Team Roles:
1)Business analyst (BA):A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements.
2)Product owner (PO): Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog. Associated mainly with flexible Agile environments, a product owner is particularly useful in scenarios where requirements and workflows frequently change.
3)Project manager (PM): project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.
4)UI/UX designer: A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.

The UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is, thus, involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more. A UI designer, in turn, devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product.
5)Software architect: An architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software design decisions on behalf of an app development team.
6)Software developer: A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.

Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.

Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.

There are full-stack developers as well. They can handle all the work at once—from clients to servers to databases and all the needed integrations.
7)Quality assurance (QA) engineer: The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.
8)Test automation engineer: A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.
8)DevOps engineer:  DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.
